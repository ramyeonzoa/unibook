# Day 5 Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Display Issue
**Problem**: Images uploaded to `uploads/images/posts/` but not displaying
**Solution**: 
- Updated `WebMvcConfig` to properly handle both absolute and relative paths
- Modified `FileUploadUtil` to return paths with `/uploads` prefix
- Added logging to debug resource handler registration

### 2. Access Control Issues
**Problem**: 
- Non-authenticated users could access `/posts/new` 
- Email-unverified users could access restricted paths
**Solution**:
- Updated `SecurityConfig` to properly distinguish between public and authenticated paths
- Enhanced `VerificationInterceptor` to check authentication first, then email verification
- Added proper redirect handling for non-authenticated users (to login) vs unverified users (to verification page)

### 3. Posts List Page Error
**Problem**: Hibernate proxy error with `post.user.department.name`
**Solution**:
- Modified `PostController` to use DTOs instead of entities
- Updated posts list template to use DTO fields (`departmentName` instead of `department.name`)
- Fixed image display to use `post.images[0].imagePath` instead of `post.postImages[0].imageUrl`

### 4. Login ReturnUrl Handling
**Problem**: After login redirect, users weren't returned to their original destination
**Solution**:
- Added hidden returnUrl field to login form
- Created custom `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` in SecurityConfig
- Handler checks for returnUrl parameter and redirects appropriately

### 5. Directory Structure
**Created**:
- `/uploads/images/posts/` directory structure
- Added `.gitkeep` to track directory
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude uploaded files but keep directory structure

## Key Code Changes

### WebMvcConfig.java
```java
String location = uploadDir.startsWith("/") ? "file:" + uploadDir : "file:./" + uploadDir;
if (!location.endsWith("/")) {
    location += "/";
}
registry.addResourceHandler("/uploads/**")
        .addResourceLocations(location);
```

### PostController.java
```java
Page<Post> posts = postService.getPostsPage(pageable, search, productType, status, schoolId);
Page<PostResponseDto> postDtos = posts.map(PostResponseDto::listFrom);
model.addAttribute("posts", postDtos);
```

### VerificationInterceptor.java
- Now checks authentication status before email verification
- Redirects non-authenticated users to `/login`
- Redirects unverified users to `/verification-required`

### SecurityConfig.java
- Added specific matchers for posts endpoints
- Created custom success handler for returnUrl support
